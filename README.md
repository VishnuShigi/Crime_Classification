# Crime_Classification
A Seq2Seq Model to classify the type of crime
The dataset for this model was downloaded from https://data.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/crime-reports
The downloaded dataset was in a csv format with various information like the date of report, title of the report, type of report and so on.
To make the model simple just to classify the type of crime only the type of the crime and the description of the title was taken for the corpus creation.
Based on the corpus a seq2seq model was developed to classify the crime.
